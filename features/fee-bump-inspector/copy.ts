  feeBidExplainer:
    "The outer amount is a bid, not a charge. A fee bump is charged for every inner operation plus one for the wrapper itself, at the network's inclusion fee for that ledger — which is decided when the transaction is included and cannot be read from an unsigned envelope. The inner fee bid no longer pays for anything once the transaction is wrapped.",

    "Signatures are counted per layer and identified only by their four-byte hints. This tool does not verify them and does not evaluate whether either account's signing thresholds are met.",
  hashNote:
    "Each copy action returns the hash of the layer it sits in. The outer hash is what the fee source signs; the inner hash is what the inner transaction's signers signed, and it is unchanged by the wrapper.",
  sequenceAdvisory:
    "This is the inner transaction's sequence number encoded in the envelope. The underlying account's current sequence may have changed since this was displayed — always re-check before submitting a real transaction.",

  noOperations: "This inner transaction declares no operations."
